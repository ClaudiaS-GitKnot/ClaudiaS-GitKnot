- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Claudia
- ðŸ‘€ Curiosity is my compass - 
      I'm fascinated by learning in all its forms.
      If there's something confusing, mysterious or unknown I want to figure it out or put in order - not without a cup of coffee in hand â˜•.
- ðŸ’» What I'm into - 
      Tecnology (new tools, clean code, exploring web development in general),
      Gaming ðŸŽ® (whether it's building empires or surviving dystopias, I'm all in),
      Dystopia and the unknown (I'm drawn to worlds unexplored and concepts that challenge the norm).
- ðŸ”§ What I'm working on - 
      Currently diving deeper into frontend development, UX and UI and building projects that make complex ideas simple.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me - cscardina88@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact about me - 
      Despite I could spend hours philosophizing about dystopian societies (yes, maybe I'm pretty obsessed ðŸš©) but I'm also the first to grab controller and build a pixel-perfect world ðŸŒŒ.
